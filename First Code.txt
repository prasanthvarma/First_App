John Adams (1735–1826) was a leader of the American Revolution and the second president of the United States (1797–1801).
He was a dedicated diarist, and corresponded with his wife and advisor Abigail, recording important historical information on the era.
As a lawyer, Adams was devoted to the right to counsel and presumption of innocence; he defied anti-British sentiment and successfully defended British soldiers against murder charges arising from the Boston Massacre.
A political activist prior to the revolution, Adams was a Massachusetts delegate to the Continental Congress. 
He assisted in drafting the Declaration of Independence in 1776 and was its foremost advocate in Congress. As a diplomat in Europe, he helped negotiate the Treaty of Paris with Britain. 
Adams was the primary author of the Massachusetts Constitution in 1780, which influenced the United States Constitution.
